### CMSC 405 Java OpenGL Project ###

#### Overview ####

This project, the second project of the CMSC 405 project series, involves the use of OpenGL and Java in the creation of an animated 3D scene containing at least six different objects of unique shape and color displayed via a Swing GUI containing scene manipulation buttons. As this was the author's first exposure to 3D graphics and OpenGL in particular, it is relatively simple and does not make use of unique light sources or shadows. However, these are cleverly simulated via the use of a utility method that paints certain sides of the various shapes darker and lighter hues depending on their orientation relative to an unseen light source. A more advanced use of OpenGL can be seen in the author's [Weekly Discussion Topics](https://github.com/andreweissen/Computer-Graphics-Weekly-Discussion-Topics) repository in the ["Week 5 - OpenGL" folder](https://github.com/andreweissen/Computer-Graphics-Weekly-Discussion-Topics/tree/master/Week%205%20-%20OpenGL). The completed project was submitted on September 14, 2018 and received a grade of 100%. The package itself contains images of the program in action, documentation files containing a more detailed decription of the project goals, and the eleven Java source files themselves.
